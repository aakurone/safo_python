@article{Bauchy2017,
abstract = {Upon loading, atomic networks can feature delayed irreversible relaxation. However, the effect of composition and structure on relaxation remains poorly understood. Herein, relying on accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and topological constraint theory, we investigate the relationship between atomic topology and stress-induced structural relaxation, by taking the example of creep deformations in calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), the binding phase of concrete. Under constant shear stress, C-S-H is found to feature delayed logarithmic shear deformations. We demonstrate that the propensity for relaxation is minimum for isostatic atomic networks, which are characterized by the simultaneous absence of floppy internal modes of relaxation and eigenstress. This suggests that topological nanoengineering could lead to the discovery of nonaging materials.},

abstract = {Using a tight-binding, total-energy model, we predict the atomic and electronic structure of the relaxed (1×1) corundum (0001) surface. The surface shows a large, bond-length-conserving relaxation, which is allowed by the topology of the surface. The relaxation is driven by a rehybridization of the surface Al atoms to sp2, and an accompanying drop in the energy of occupied surface states, during the relaxation. Displacements of surface atoms from bulk positions are as large as 0.7, and should be observable using a low-energy electron diffraction intensity analysis. Full relaxed atomic positions are reported, as well as a wavelength-resolved surface band structure, including orbital characters of surface states. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

@incollection{Bauchy2019,
abstract = {Topological constraint theory has become an increasingly popular tool to predict the compositional dependence of glass properties or pinpoint promising compositions with tailored functionalities. This approach reduces complex disordered networks into simpler mechanical trusses. Thereby, topological constraint theory captures the important atomic topology that controls macroscopic properties while filtering out less relevant second-order structural details. As such, topological constraint theory can be used to decode the genome of glass, that is, to identify and decipher how the basic structural building blocks of glasses control their engineering properties—in the same way as the human genome offers information that serves as a blueprint for an individual's growth and development. Thanks to its elegance and simplicity, topological constraint theory has enabled the development of various physics-based models that can analytically predict various properties of glass. In this Chapter, I introduce some general background in glass science, concepts of atomic rigidity, and topological constraint theory. The topological constraints enumeration scheme is presented for various archetypical glasses and is used to understand the origin of their glass-forming ability. Finally, various topological models enabling the prediction of glass properties are reviewed, with a focus on hardness, fracture toughness, viscosity, fragility, glass transition temperature, and dissolution kinetics.},

@article{Gutierrez2002,
abstract = {The structural properties of amorphous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been investigated by means of the molecular dynamics technique. The simulations were done in a microcanonical ensemble, using a pairwise potential, on systems with up to 1800 particles. Three different systems, at densities ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 g/cm3, were prepared by quenching from the melt. The network topology of our system is analyzed through partial pair correlations, coordination numbers, angle distributions, and ring statistics. A detailed analysis of the interatomic distances reveals that in the amorphous state there is a short-range order dominated by a slightly distorted (AlO4)5? tetrahedron, in agreement with recent experimental results. This conclusion is supported by the distribution of nearest-neighbor coordination numbers, where more than 75\% of Al atoms have four O as nearest-neighbors. Ring statistics reveal the presence of two- to fivefold rings, with a peak at the fourfold ring and where the two- and threefold rings are planar. Comparison with available experimental data and earlier calculations shows that the structures of amorphous and liquid alumina are very similar. The amorphous structure also presents close similarities to the surface structure of ? -alumina at room temperature. Simulations for systems at different densities show that the coordination number of the elementary unit increases as the density increases, suggesting that the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated forms of amorphous alumina found experimentally correspond to different densities.
