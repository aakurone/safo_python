*SäFo Python*

Some Python scripts and Fortran subroutines for computational demos in the lecture course [FYS1004 Säteilykentät ja fotonit](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/hy-CU-117533904-2021-08-01), Department of Physics, University of Helsinki.

Fortran subroutines are built so that they can be compiled by `f2py` as Python modules.

Not well documented.
